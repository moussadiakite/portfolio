          As a software engineer, you must learn fast and efficiently to keep up
          with the fast pace of the software industry. A great way to achieve this
          is to learn by doing since it allows you to gain practical and real-world
          experience. This method of learning is not only effective but also helps
          you to become proficient in your field more quickly. Here are some tips
          to help you learn any new concept/technology:
        </p>

        <h4>Start by understanding the basics</h4>

        <p>
          Before you start practicing, it is important that you have a basic understanding
          of the concept or technology you will be using. This can be achieved by watching
          a short tutorial or video that explains the basics. While it is not necessary to
          spend hours following a course, it is important to have a foundation to build upon.
          This step should not take more than an hour of your time.
        </p>

        <h4>Keep a list of learning resources</h4>

        <p>
          As you work on projects, you are likely to come across new resources that can help
          you to better understand the topic. Make a list of these resources, using websites
          like Google, Reddit, StackOverflow, Quora, and official documentation, as well as
          learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning. By keeping track of
          the resources you use, you can easily refer back to them in the future or share them
          with others.
        </p>

        <h4>Find a related project that inspires passion</h4>

        <p>
          To truly benefit from learning by doing, it is important to find an activity that you
          are deeply interested in: develop a personal project, solve coding challenges, contribute
          to open source, or participate in hackathons that you are passionate about. Passion,
          dedication, and persistence will help you stay motivated as you test your theories, do
          extensive research, and develop various solutions.
        </p>

        <h4>Start working on the project</h4>

        <p>
          It’s time to begin your project now that you know a little about the topic and have a list
          of resources. For each step, you can refer to the list mentioned in point 2, search online,
          or ask for advice in community boards or user groups like StackOverflow. Remember, you do
          not have to rely on a single course or tutorial — feel free to use a variety of resources
          to help you understand the topic better.
        </p>

        <h4>Review and update your notes</h4>

        <p>
          After you have finished implementing and testing your solution, take some time to review and
          update your notes on what you did throughout the project. These notes will be useful for future
          reference or for sharing with others. By reviewing your notes, you can ensure that you have a
          complete understanding of the project and can easily refer back to them in the future.
        </p>

        <h4>Next Steps</h4>

        <p>
          As you complete more projects, you will be able to develop your own approach and learn how to
          learn by doing more effectively. By following these tips, you will gain an array of practical
          skills and knowledge and become a very successful software engineer.

          Most photographers find it hard to see interesting pictures in places
          in which they are most familiar. A trip somewhere new seems always
          exactly what our photography needed, as shooting away from home
          consistently inspires us to new artistic heights.

          The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time
          to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different angles,
          with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move to the
          left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house again.
